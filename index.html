            <h3>Academic Study and Real Study</h3>
            <p>You might saw to go to a college of an university, taking class on various subjects related to Computer Science & Engineering. So, you might understand that I'm a CSE student. But, there is another thing I have been doing which you can not see because it's online and I'm doing it when I'm at my home. It's actually an online course related to Web application development which I gave the title of real study!</p>
